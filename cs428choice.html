    <h1>Phasmophobia VR</h1>
    <h3>CS 428 - Student's Choice Presentation Topic</h3>
    <p>
        The topic I will be covering is a newly released game called Phasmophobia, a horror game that was released fairly recently on September 18th, 2020.
        Phasmophobia is a four player online cooperative psychological horror game. It involves the players teaming up to track down and gather evidence about the ghosts.
        The team of players can use night vision cameras, EMF readers, thermometers, and all sorts of other equipment to assist for all sorts of different types of ghosts, 
        each with their own unique traits. With realistic graphics and sounds that give a highly immersive experience in experiencing ghost hunting, it makes an exceptional
        use of virtual reality capabilities.
