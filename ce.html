            What is Halo?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Halo is a first person shooter style video game series created by Bungie, and now in development by 343 Industries.
            The game features one of the last Spartans, a genetically modified super soldier named Master Chief, accompanied by
            Cortana, an artificial intelligence, battling various aliens to discover the secrets of the Halo ring, which is an
            artificial ring shaped world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Halo: Combat Evolved, often known as Halo CE, is the first installment of this franchise, coming out on the original
            Xbox in 2001 and on PC in 2003. It is known as one of the greatest video games of all time due to its innovation
            as the novel FPS, with the artificial intelligence that is used within the game for the non-playable characters and
            its brilliancy in the creation of cooperative online multiplayer play.

            What is speedrunning?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Speedrunning is a play-through of a game in a way to beat the game as fast as possible.
            There are all sorts of speedruns, some with some necessary criteria to meet such as collecting all the items, some
            without using glitches or exploits, and other random goals or limitations that a player has to meet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Halo CE Speedrunning is focused on beating the main campaign of the game. There are two difficulties that most
            speedrunners focus on, which are the Easy and Legendary difficulties. Easy is primarily focused on optimized
            movement and trick execution, with refined combat sections, while Legendary is more so focused on the difficulty
            of these combat sections, while still maintaining the necessary trick execution and movement. Both difficulties have
            their own merits and have unique qualities to each of their runs.
